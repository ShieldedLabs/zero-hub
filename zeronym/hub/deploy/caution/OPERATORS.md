# Running the zero-indexer-hub (operator guide)

The hub is where diverted migrations land. Shims divert Orchard-touching
`SendTransaction`s to it over the **Nym mixnet**; the hub holds them in a
short-lived queue, then broadcasts them to the Zcash network through indexers you
configure.

**Read this first: of the two components, this is the one that sees plaintext.**
The shim's enclave hides migrations *from the indexer operator*. The hub is where
that content arrives in the clear. It is therefore the component whose
attestation matters most — an unattested hub proves nothing that running the
binary on a laptop would not, while being trusted with exactly the data the
system exists to protect.

**One hub.** The current design assumes a single hub operator. That is why there
is no hub directory, no failover, and a single address baked into every shim.

## What the hub does, precisely

- **Receives** submissions over its own Nym mixnet client. It cannot reply to a
  sender who exposed their address instead of sending anonymously, and drops such
  messages rather than queueing them.
- **Queues** them in RAM, bounded by an explicit byte budget (64 MiB), which is
  what bounds this enclave's memory against someone who simply keeps submitting.
- **Flushes** the batch on a cadence, broadcasting every member to **every**
  configured indexer — a migration that entered only one mempool is one outage
  away from never being mined.
- **Answers lookups** so a wallet can see its own just-diverted transaction
  before it is mined.

It deliberately does **not** validate transactions. There is no consensus check,
no signature or proof verification, no fee or double-spend check: the hub
broadcasts what it is given and lets the network decide. It also broadcasts
transactions it could not parse, by design.

The queue is deliberately **not persisted**. An enclave is diskless, and
persisting it would mean writing plaintext migrations somewhere the host could
read them — the one thing this component exists to prevent. A restart drops the
queue; see "Known failure modes".

## Prerequisites

Same platform prerequisites as the shim (`shim/deploy/caution/OPERATORS.md`): a
Caution account with a FIDO2 authenticator, the `caution` CLI, a push key, and a
DNS name you control. Additionally:

- **Indexers to broadcast through**, each as a literal `IPv4:port` speaking gRPC
  over TLS, plus the DNS name their certificates carry.
- **Capacity and credit.** Fully-managed deploys refuse below a credit minimum,
  and the enforced figure has disagreed with the dashboard's stated one. It fails
  *before* building, so nothing is wasted, but budget for it.

## Deploy

Create the public repo for the assembled tree first (see "Verify"), then:

```bash
sh zeronym/hub/deploy/caution/assemble-caution.sh \
  --name        <enclave-name> \
  --indexers    <ipv4>:<port>[,<ipv4>:<port>...] \
  --indexer-tls <name-on-indexer-cert> \
  --tls-domain  <hub-domain> \
  --app-source  <public-git-url> \
  --nym \
  --nym-egress  92.39.63.14/32:443:tcp \
  --nym-egress  0.0.0.0/0:9000:tcp \
  --nym-egress  1.1.1.1/32:53:udp
```

- `--indexers` are literal IPv4 addresses. The enclave resolves **no DNS** for
  them (there is no port 53 rule for that path), so a poisoned answer has nothing
  to poison.
- **`--indexer-tls` is not optional in practice.** Without it the broadcast hop
  is plaintext and the enclave's parent host reads every batch in the clear
  moments before it is public — which would undo most of the reason this runs in
  an enclave.
- `--nym` turns on mixnet reception; the `--nym-egress` rules are the enclave's
  entire allowlist for reaching the mixnet (nym-api, a gateway, a DNS resolver).
- **Do NOT use `--nym-gateway` yet.** It pins the entry gateway by IDENTITY key
  while the egress rule needs its IP ADDRESS; a mismatch fails closed with no
  console. Untested against public Nym.
- **Never pass `--debug`.** Debug mode disables attestation. See the warning at
  the top of this file.

Then, from the directory it creates:

```bash
caution login --qr --username <name>
caution apps create           # prints the app id
  # -> create DNS: <hub-domain>  CNAME  <app-id>.apps.caution.sh   (BEFORE the push)
git push caution main         # builds, boots, health-checks (~20 min cold)
```

DNS ordering, the ACME race, and the certificate budget behave exactly as
described in the shim guide — read that section; it applies here unchanged.

## Verify

```bash
caution verify --attestation-url https://<hub-domain>/attestation
```

Pass `--attestation-url` explicitly: a fully-managed app writes no
`.caution/deployment.json`, so verify has nothing to infer from, and the error it
prints suggests `caution init`, which would wrongly provision an AWS stack.

Expect `✓ Attestation verification PASSED` with all three PCRs reproducing and
the TLS certificate binding verified. Measured on the first attested hub
(2026-08-14): all of PCR0/1/2 matched, and the manifest correctly recorded the
published app source and commit.

**Require all three PCRs. Do not accept a PCR2 match alone.** Advice circulated,
while PCR0/1 were failing for an unrelated reason, that "PCR2 is the application
layer and the check that matters". That is wrong on this platform: measured
2026-08-14, the attested hub and the attested shim — two entirely different
binaries — produced **byte-identical PCR2** (`21b9efbc…`), while PCR0/PCR1
differed per application (`218d1f64…` hub, `accb679a…` shim). PCR2 does not
distinguish the application, so an attestation accepted on PCR2 alone would prove
only that *some* Caution enclave is running, not that it is running the reviewed
hub — which for the component holding plaintext migrations is the whole point.
(Empirical observation; not confirmed with Caution which layer each index
measures.)

Publish the assembled tree to the `--app-source` repo — `main`, plus a tag on the
deployed commit, since the manifest pins branch **and** commit and a branch tip
moves. Caution's own git remote is push-only, so this published repo is the only
route an auditor has to what you deployed. `zeronym/deploy.sh` does this
automatically on an attested deploy.

## Handing your address to shims

The hub's Nym address is what every shim is built against. Read it with:

```bash
curl https://<hub-domain>/nym-address
```

That endpoint exists because an attested enclave has **no SSH**: without it the
address could be read *or* the binary proved, never both. It returns `503` with an
explicit message until the mixnet client has connected, so an empty answer is
never mistaken for a valid address.

Hand that string to each shim operator; they bake it in with `--hub-nym`. There is
no discovery mechanism — the handoff is a human message, which is a deliberate
simplification of the one-hub design.

`/healthz` answers `200 ok` for liveness. Nothing exposes queue depth, batch size,
or counts: those would be an oracle for the anonymity-set size.

### Is the hub actually reachable? Check `/nym-status`, not the other two

```
curl https://<hub-domain>/nym-status
{"mixnet_connected":true,"address_published":true,"client_deaths":0,"consecutive_rebuild_failures":0}
```

**`/nym-address` and `/healthz` cannot tell you this, by design.** The address is
deliberately KEPT when the mixnet client dies — shims are baked against it, and it
comes back on rebuild — so `/nym-address` answers 200 whether or not the hub can
currently receive anything, and `/healthz` only says the process is alive.

That combination is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-14 an attested hub answered both
with 200 for hours while carrying no mixnet traffic at all; a shim and hub run
locally against the same public mixnet round-tripped a lookup in 5.6 s, which is
what identified the deployed hub rather than the network.

| field | alert when |
|---|---|
| `mixnet_connected` | `false` — **the hub is receiving nothing**; every shim's diverts are failing closed |
| `address_published` | `false` after startup — the client has never connected |
| `client_deaths` | climbing: gateway churn |
| `consecutive_rebuild_failures` | growing — it is down and not recovering; at 60 it takes a NEW identity and every shim needs re-pointing |

Poll `mixnet_connected`. It is the single field that says whether the system is
carrying migrations.

## Known failure modes

**1. A restart changes your address and silently breaks every shim.** The identity
lives in RAM. A client *reconnect* keeps it — that was fixed deliberately, and
matters because the SDK reconnects often — but a **process restart** mints a new
one. Every shim then fails its diverts closed until re-pointed, and nothing tells
them. After 60 consecutive failed rebuilds the hub also deliberately takes a fresh
identity to get back onto the mixnet at all, logging loudly.

- **Detect:** poll `/nym-address` and alert on change.
- **Recover:** send the new address to every shim operator; each re-assembles and
  redeploys. Plan for this being slow, and prefer not restarting the hub.

**2. A restart drops queued migrations that wallets were already told succeeded.**
Shims answer the wallet as soon as a migration is dispatched onto the mixnet, and
your queue is RAM-only until the next flush. A restart in that window loses those
migrations with no error reaching anyone. Inherent to the diskless design.
Consequence to communicate: **wallets must resend when a transaction never
confirms.** Resends are safe — the queue deduplicates on payload hash.

**3. Mixnet bandwidth exhaustion.** Nym's free tier meters volume and your client
emits continuous cover traffic. When it runs out, reception stops. No ticketbook
(paid credential) mechanism is wired up yet.

**4. Anyone who knows your address can submit.** There is no submitter ACL. The
64 MiB queue budget is the only thing bounding an abusive submitter.

## If the hub goes down: the failover runbook

There is **no standby today**. Failover is a manual, multi-party operation, and it
is worth reading before you need it rather than during.

**What breaks, and how it looks.** The hub's identity lives in RAM, so a *process
restart* — crash, redeploy, enclave replacement — comes back with a **new Nym
address**, while every shim is baked with the old one. Then:

- **Submits are silently lost.** A shim answers its wallet the moment a migration
  is handed to the mixnet; a frame addressed to an address nobody is listening at
  is simply undeliverable, and no error reaches anyone.
- **Lookups fail closed** (`UNAVAILABLE`), which is the visible symptom.

A client *reconnect* is different and safe: the address survives it deliberately,
and that has been observed holding for ~13 hours across gateway churn.

**Detect it:** poll `/nym-status` for `mixnet_connected`, and watch `/nym-address`
for a *changed* value. Do not infer health from `/nym-address` returning 200 — it
answers with the last address published even after the client is gone, which is
precisely how a dead hub went unnoticed for hours on 2026-08-14.

**Recover:**

1. Redeploy the hub (destroy → create → CNAME → push; managed apps are
   immutable, so the app id and CNAME both change). **~25 min**, measured twice:
   the push alone is 20–23 min, of which **15–17 min is the builder downloading
   dependencies** — remote, and nothing local speeds it up. Note the CNAME step
   sits in the middle and blocks, so if DNS is someone else's job, wake them
   first.
2. Confirm `mixnet_connected: true` — do not skip this; a hub can boot, serve TLS,
   and answer `/healthz` while receiving nothing.
3. Read the new address from `/nym-address`.
4. **Send it to every shim operator.** There is no discovery mechanism; the
   handoff is a human message.
5. Each shim operator re-assembles with the new `--hub-nym` and redeploys
   (**~25 min each**, and their app id and CNAME change too). These can run in
   parallel across operators; nothing serialises them once they have the address.

Budget **well over an hour** end to end, during which migrations are failing.
`caution verify` is a further ~7 min but does NOT belong on the critical path —
restore service first, verify after.

**Why it cannot currently be better.** A standby cannot be pre-baked into shims,
because a diskless hub has no address until it runs — and if it runs, it is *hot*,
so both hubs broadcast and the batch splits across two moments. Nor can the
identity be supplied by config to keep the address stable: that would put the
hub's Nym private key where the host operator can read it, and anyone holding it
can impersonate the hub and **receive migrations**. Downtime is the better
failure.

**What would fix it** (not built): shims fetch the current hub address at runtime
from a published endpoint, but accept it only if signed by a key baked into their
audited config. That keeps the property the baking exists for — an operator
cannot silently repoint a shim at a hub they control — while reducing failover to
a poll interval. Until then, treat hub restarts as expensive and rare.

## Operating rules

- **Never `--debug`.** It disables attestation.
- **Never raise `RUST_LOG` to debug** on a deployed enclave. The hub logs only
  counts and dispositions, never a txid or transaction body, precisely because in
  an enclave the log reaches the parent host. Raising the level would leak exactly
  what this component protects.
- **`ZIH_HTTP_SUBMIT` stays off.** The clearnet `POST /` submit path is disabled
  by default; with the mixnet carrying submissions nothing legitimate posts there,
  while the enclave accepts inbound from anywhere. Disabled, it returns the same
  `404` as any unknown path, so a scanner cannot tell it exists.
- **Certificates**: diskless means every restart is a fresh ACME order, against 5
  production issuances per name per week. Iterate on throwaway names.
- **Watch Certificate Transparency** for your hub domain.

| `ZIH_NYM` | receive submissions over the mixnet | `true` |
