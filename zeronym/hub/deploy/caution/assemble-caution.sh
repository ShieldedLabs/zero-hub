# Assemble the Caution deploy repository for zero-indexer-hub.
#
# A Caution app is a git repository you push to; whatever is at its root is what
# gets built into an EIF. So this produces exactly that: the reproducible build
# context, plus caution.hcl and a Containerfile at the root where Caution looks
# for them.
#
# Everything comes from `git archive HEAD` by way of deploy/assemble.sh. Nothing
# is read from the working tree, which is what makes "the enclave runs the code
# at commit X" a checkable statement rather than a hope.
#
# POSIX sh with no pipelines, for the reason recorded in assemble.sh: /bin/sh is
# dash on Debian and Ubuntu, dash has no `-o pipefail`, and a pipeline without it
# hides the exit status of everything but the last command.
#
# Usage:
#   sh .../assemble-caution.sh --name <enclave> \
#       --indexers <ip:port[,ip:port...]> --indexer-tls <indexer-cert-name> \
#       --tls-domain <hub-domain> \
#       [--app-source <public-git-url>] \
#       [--nym --nym-egress <cidr:port[:proto]> ... [--nym-gateway <id>] [--ack-wait-ms <n>]] \
#       [--debug --ssh-key "<ssh pubkey>" ...] \
#       [dest-dir]
#
# --ack-wait-ms sets ZIH_ACK_WAIT_ADDITION_MS: how much longer the hub's mixnet
# client waits for a packet's ack before RETRANSMITTING it. Measured 2026-08-17:
# every enclave-hosted hub's replies reached the shim with 15-25 duplicate
# fragments per lookup (a local hub's, ~1), because the SDK computes the ack
# deadline from CONFIGURED mix delays and an enclave's real ack path is slower.
# Each duplicate costs a send slot at the throttled rate and the SDK's rate
# controller backs off further as they pile up, so lookups took 45-90 s. Use
# 15000 on an enclave hub: 6000 was tried on hub-5 and still left two of four
# replies retransmitted in their entirety, so the enclave's ack path is far
# slower than that or lossy; 15000 trims the late-ack tail as far as is worth
# trimming and costs nothing on a fast path. It does NOT fix lost acks. Leave it
# unset locally, where the SDK default of 1500 produces zero retransmissions.
#
# --app-source records, in the manifest's build block, the public git URL where
# this assembled repository is published. `caution verify` clones that URL and
# rebuilds; without it verify refuses outright and the attestation proves only
# that SOME image runs in a real enclave. The hub is the component that holds
# migrations in plaintext, so it is the one that most needs to be checkable.
#
# --debug opens the enclave console over SSH (attestation OFF; diagnostic only). It
# REQUIRES --ssh-key: the authorized console key is an input, not a value baked into
# the repo, so whoever deploys is whoever can read the console. --ssh-key is
# repeatable and takes a full public-key line, e.g.
#   --ssh-key "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)"
#
# --nym additionally runs the hub's own Nym mixnet client so shims can submit over
# the mixnet (it logs its Nym address at startup; publish that to shims as
# --hub-nym). It needs one or more --nym-egress rules for the gateway/nym-api set
# (from the host operator). The nym-api endpoint is NOT configurable here, so
# those rules have to agree with what nym-sdk's own built-in endpoint list
# resolves to on the day; the checks in the --nym block say what breaks when they
# stop agreeing. The HTTP submit path stays either way; a fully mixnet-only hub
# (no inbound port) is the M7 tightening.
#
# Unlike the shim (one enclave fronts one indexer), the hub broadcasts through a
# SET of endpoints, so --indexers takes a comma-separated list and one egress /32
# is emitted per endpoint. All four arguments are required: a hub with the wrong
# indexers broadcasts nowhere useful, a hub with no domain has no certificate for
# the shim to verify, and a hub without --indexer-tls sends every batch in the
# clear past its own enclave boundary.
