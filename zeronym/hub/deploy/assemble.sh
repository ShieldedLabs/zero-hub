# Assemble the zero-indexer-hub build context: a partial mirror of the zero repo
# containing the hub plus exactly the parts of zebra/ and zaino/ its path
# dependencies need. Sibling of zeronym/shim/deploy/assemble.sh, and now the same
# shape: the hub broadcasts through an indexer's CompactTxStreamer, so it carries
# zaino-proto just as the shim does.
#
# Everything comes out of `git archive HEAD`, never the working tree. Three
# reasons, all of them load-bearing:
#   1. Provenance: the context is exactly the recorded SHA, so "rebuild from
#      source" has an unambiguous meaning. That includes the Containerfile,
#      which IS the build; see the recipe-provenance block near the bottom.
#   2. The vendored zebra/ subtree CANNOT be dirtied, because the working copy
#      is never touched. Vendored trees are read-only for us.
#   3. Determinism: git archive stamps every entry with the commit timestamp,
#      so file mtimes in the context are identical on every machine.
#
# No network access is required.
#
# PORTABILITY: this is POSIX sh, deliberately. Callers invoke it as
# `sh assemble.sh`, which bypasses any shebang, and on Debian and Ubuntu /bin/sh
# is dash. dash has no `-o pipefail`, so this uses `set -eu` and no pipelines:
# each `git archive` writes a tar file whose exit status `set -e` actually
# checks. Do not reintroduce a pipeline here without pipefail, and do not
# reintroduce pipefail.
#
# Usage: sh zeronym/hub/deploy/assemble.sh [dest-dir]

set -eu

# Context file modes must not depend on who runs the script (see the shim's
# assemble.sh for the full argument): git archive records the committed mode but
# `tar -x` masks it with the invoking user's umask. Belt and braces: umask here,
# `-p` on every extraction below.

# zebra: the workspace root manifest plus two member directories. Not the tree.
#
#   Cargo.toml   REQUIRED. zebra-chain inherits roughly fifty dependency entries
#                plus authors/license/edition/rust-version and [lints] from
#                [workspace.*]. Without it, cargo cannot parse zebra-chain's
#                manifest.
#   zebra-chain  the actual dependency, the vendored Zcash parser.
#   zebra-test   REQUIRED, AND NEVER COMPILED. It is an optional dependency of
#                zebra-chain that only appears under dev-dependencies, but cargo
#                must still load its manifest to RESOLVE the graph. Dropping it
#                fails at resolution, not compile time. It costs context bytes
#                and zero build time. Do not optimise it away.
#
# The other members listed in zebra/Cargo.toml are not needed: cargo only reads
# the workspace root for inheritance here, and does not require absent members
# to exist.
#
# Keep this list, and the zaino one below, in sync with the `paths:` filter of
# .github/workflows/zeronym-hub-reproduce.yml. A subtree pull that touches one
# of these directories changes the binary and therefore the recorded hash, so
# the reproduce job has to fire on it.

# only BINDS when nym-sdk is in the graph (that feature), but the path has to

# Deliberately NOT in the context: orchard/. zebra/Cargo.toml carries a [zero]
# patch `orchard = { path = "../orchard" }`, but that patch belongs to zebra's
# workspace and does not apply to the hub's own; the hub resolves orchard from
# crates.io per its committed Cargo.lock, and cargo does not complain about the
# dangling patch path when it merely loads zebra's manifest for inheritance.
#
# Also not needed: zebra/Cargo.lock or either tree's rust-toolchain.toml. The
# hub's own lockfile is authoritative, and the pinned pallet-rust digest is the
# toolchain.
