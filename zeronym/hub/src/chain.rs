//! The hub's connection to the Zcash network, through an indexer.
//!
//! Two calls and nothing else: `GetLightdInfo` gives the height that drives
//! flush scheduling and expiry admission, and `SendTransaction` publishes each
//! member of a flushed batch. The hub deliberately does NOT run a validator
//! in-enclave: mainnet state is hundreds of gigabytes and an enclave is
//! diskless, so it speaks to infrastructure that already exists.
//!
//! **Why an indexer rather than a node's JSON-RPC.** The indexer endpoint is
//! already published over TLS, which the enclave requires: without TLS on this
//! hop the enclave's parent host reads every batch in the clear moments before
//! it is public. Speaking `CompactTxStreamer` also means the hub broadcasts
//! through exactly the interface wallets use, so nothing about a batched
//! migration looks different from an ordinary submission at the point it enters
//! the network.
//!
//! The honest cost, recorded rather than hidden: an indexer is a single funnel
//! in front of a single node, so the "publish to every node" property in
//! `REVIEW.md` #6 is weaker here than with direct multi-node broadcast. Configure
//! more than one endpoint where you can; a batch that entered only one mempool
//! is one outage away from never being mined.
//!
//! gRPC is spoken directly over hyper rather than through tonic. The surface is
//! two unary calls, and the enclave constraint (dial a literal address, verify a
//! DNS NAME, resolve nothing) is awkward to express through a tonic channel but
//! trivial here.
