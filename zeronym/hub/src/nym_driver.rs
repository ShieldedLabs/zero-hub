//! The mixnet driver: the one place in the hub that owns a `nym-sdk` client.
//!
//! [`crate::nym::run_listener`] is SDK-free and speaks only in channels: a
//! [`Received`] per inbound request, a [`Reply`] per answer. This module is the
//! other end. It owns one client and does nothing but move bytes:
//!
//!   * every non-empty inbound message with a sender tag becomes a [`Received`]
//!     (the SDK's `AnonymousSenderTag` converted to the opaque [`SenderTag`], so
//!     the listener never sees an SDK type); the empty ones are SURB-
//!     replenishment artifacts (D12) and are dropped;
//!   * a message that arrives WITHOUT a sender tag is a shim that exposed its own
//!     address instead of sending anonymously (D3). The hub cannot reply to it
//!     and would not want to hold it, so it is dropped with a warning, never
//!     queued;
//!   * each [`Reply`] goes back to its tag as an anonymous SURB reply, unless
//!     it has outlived [`crate::nym::REPLY_DEADLINE`] in the queue, in which
//!     case it is dropped rather than emitted to a shim that has given up.
//!
//! Unlike the shim's driver there is no rotation and no supervisor: the hub's
//! address is what every shim sends to (D10), so it holds ONE identity for the
//! life of the process — and, since the storage below outlives the rebuild loop,
//! ACROSS rebuilds too.
//!
//! **The address survives a client death.** One [`Ephemeral`] store is built
//! once and cloned into every (re)build, and the SDK's initialisation loads
//! existing keys before it generates any, so a rebuild comes back with the same
//! identity key, the same encryption key, and the same gateway registration —
//! hence the same Nym address. That matters because the address is baked into
//! every shim's enclave config and a Caution managed app is immutable, so an
//! address change costs every operator a re-assemble and redeploy. Before this,
//! the client minted a fresh identity on every rebuild and the shim fleet was
//! stale the moment a gateway blipped.
//!
//! What still changes the address: a real process restart (the store is in RAM,
//! and a diskless enclave has nowhere to persist it), and the deliberate
//! fallback below when the stored gateway registration is beyond saving. Both
//! are loud, and both leave existing shims holding the OLD address until they
//! are re-pointed — the address-distribution problem is not solved here, only
//! made rare. `/nym-address` on the serving path is how an attested hub's
//! operator reads the current value without a console.
//!
//! It rebuilds rather than exiting so the hub's clearnet serving and batcher stay
//! up. Shutdown disconnects the client cleanly (D12: `disconnect()` is not
//! cancel-safe and a dropped LIVE client leaks its background tasks); a client
//! that already died is dropped, its tasks having already stopped.
//!
//! The driver also probes its OWN inbound path (see the liveness section in
//! [`run_driver`]): a client that connects, sends, and is never delivered to is
//! reported by nothing else, and on the one node every shim points at that is a
//! silent, permanent outage that reads as healthy.
