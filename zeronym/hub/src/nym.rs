//! The hub's inbound path over the Nym mixnet: receive a `SubmitV1`, admit it,
//! reply with an `AckV1`; receive a `LookupV1`, answer it with a
//! `LookupReplyV1`.
//!
//! The design keeps the Nym SDK out of everything here. A driver task (which
//! lands with the SDK) owns the mixnet client and does nothing but move bytes:
//! it hands each inbound message to this module as a [`Received`] and sends each
//! [`Reply`] this module produces back out. So the listen loop is a plain async
//! function over two channels plus the shared cores, and its whole behaviour is
//! exercised by feeding the channels directly, with no SDK and no fake client.
//!
//! What crosses the channels is BYTES and an opaque [`SenderTag`], never a domain
//! object: the tag is carried from a request to its reply and never
//! interpreted, logged, or stored, because it is a per-session pseudonym for the
//! requesting shim and the whole point of the hop is to hold none of those.
//!
//! Admission is [`crate::server::Hub::admit`] and lookup is
//! [`crate::server::Hub::lookup`], the exact calls the HTTP serving path uses,
//! so the two ingress paths cannot drift. Everything REVIEW.md binds on those
//! calls binds here too: an unparseable transaction is queued and published,
//! never refused (#5); only counts, reasons, and dispositions are logged, never
//! a txid, a queried hash, or a body (#157).
//!
//! Every [`Reply`] carries the instant its request was pulled off the inbound
//! channel, and [`REPLY_DEADLINE`] says how long after that it is still worth
//! sending. The driver drains replies one at a time at the mixnet's throttled
//! emission rate, so under a burst the queue behind it can hold answers older
//! than the shim's whole request budget; those are dropped rather than emitted.
