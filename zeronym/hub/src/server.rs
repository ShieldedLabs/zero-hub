//!
//! A submission is **admitted, not broadcast**. It joins the queue and is
//! published at the next cadence boundary together with everything else admitted
//! in that window (see [`crate::batcher`]). The acknowledgement carries the txid
//! the hub computes from the bytes, so the wallet gets the txid it expects
//! immediately even though publication is minutes away.
//!
//! Safety rails from `REVIEW.md` that bind on this path:
//!
//! * **Re-parse is telemetry, never a refusal (#5).** A transaction the hub
//!   cannot parse is precisely one the shim deliberately diverted because it
//!   could not read it either, so refusing it would invert the shim's fail-safe
//!   into a leak. `sendrawtransaction` at the node is the only authority on
//!   validity; the hub publishes what it is given.
//! * **Never log a txid or a transaction body (#157).** In an enclave the log
//!   reaches the parent host, and the txid is the one fact this system exists to
//!   withhold. Only counts and dispositions are logged.
//! * **Zeroize the decrypted bytes (#161).** Held bytes live in
//!   [`zeroize::Zeroizing`] for as long as they are queued.
//! * **Never return a queue depth or batch size down this channel.** That would
//!   be a live anonymity-set-size oracle for anyone who can run a shim, and a
//!   real-time "the fleet is unprotected right now" feed for an adversary
//!   choosing when to correlate. The response says admitted or refused, and
//!   nothing about how much company the entry has.
