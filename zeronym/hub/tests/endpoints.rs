//! The hub's read-only endpoints, and the closed clearnet submit path.
//!
//! Both exist because of the same fact: an ATTESTED enclave has no console.
//! `GET /nym-address` publishes the address the hub minted (previously
//! log-only, so reading it required debug mode, which disables attestation —
//! reading it and proving it were mutually exclusive). `GET /healthz` says the
//! process is serving.
//!
//! The third property here is a subtraction. `POST /` used to accept an
//! unauthenticated submission from anyone on the internet, on an enclave that
//! declares `ingress 0.0.0.0/0` and has no submitter ACL by design. With the
//! mixnet carrying submissions, nothing legitimate posts there, so it is off
//! unless `ServeOptions::http_submit` asks for it (NYM_PLAN M7).
//!
//! What every assertion below also guards: these responses carry the address
//! and liveness and NOTHING else. A queue depth or batch size returned here
//! would be a live anonymity-set-size oracle for anyone who can reach the hub,
//! which `server.rs`'s header forbids — and unlike the shim-facing paths, these
//! are reachable by everyone.
